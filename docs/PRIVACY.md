# Privacy Policy

**Quivlo · Last updated: February 2025**

---

## In short (TL;DR)

Quivlo runs entirely on your device. We don’t use a backend, accounts, or analytics. We don’t collect, send, or store your content on our servers. Text and flashcards stay on your iPhone. If we add features later, we’ll update this policy.

## Introduction

Quivlo (“we,” “our,” or “the app”) is an iOS app that helps you turn what you read into flashcards you can review and share. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use Quivlo. We built Quivlo to be private by design: processing happens on your device, and we do not operate servers that store your content.

## Information We Collect

Quivlo is designed to collect as little information as possible.

- **We do not collect account or login data.** There are no user accounts.
- **We do not collect your flashcard content, pasted text, or imported screenshots** on any server. All of this stays on your device.
- **We do not use analytics or advertising SDKs.** We do not track how you use the app for analytics or ads.
- **We do not collect device identifiers** for tracking across apps or websites.

Any text you paste, content extracted from links, or text obtained from screenshots via OCR is processed only on your iPhone and is not sent to us or any third party.

## How We Use Information

Because we do not collect personal data from the app, there is no data for us to “use” in the traditional sense. All processing is done locally on your device so you can create, edit, save, and share flashcards. We do not use your information for marketing, profiling, or any other purpose.

## Data Storage & Security

All saved flashcards and “My Cards” sets are stored only in Quivlo’s local storage on your device. We do not have access to this data. If you delete Quivlo, all of this data is removed with the app. We do not use cloud backup of your app data on our own servers.

## Sharing of Information

We do not share your information with third parties because we do not collect it. When you use the app’s share feature (e.g. to share a flashcard image to LinkedIn or AirDrop), sharing is handled entirely by iOS. You choose where the image goes; Quivlo does not send any data to us or to other parties.

## Permissions

Quivlo may ask for the following permission:

- **Photo Library** – Only when you explicitly choose to import a screenshot to turn into flashcards. We do not access your photos in the background or for any other purpose. We do not use microphone, camera recording, contacts, or location.

## Third-Party Services

Quivlo uses Apple’s built-in frameworks to provide functionality:

- **Vision** – For on-device OCR when you import screenshots.
- **NaturalLanguage** – For on-device language processing to help create flashcards.

These run entirely on your device. We do not integrate analytics, ads, or other third-party SDKs that collect personal data.

## Children’s Privacy

Quivlo is not directed at children. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us and we will address it.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time, for example if we add new features or if the law changes. We will post the updated policy on this page and, for the app, we may notify you via the App Store listing or an in-app notice where appropriate. Continued use of Quivlo after changes means you accept the updated policy.
